## About

Thanks for checking out my personal site and blog created using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll.</a> I'm using this site to keep current with best security practices in the industry, as well as practice
vulnerability deployment on various vulnerable images primarily taken from the site <a href="http://vulnhub.com/" target="_blank">VulnHub.</a> I recently graduated from the Unviersity of New Hampshire where I received my Bachelor in Information Technology and Bachelor in Justice Studies.
Please feel free to reach out with any comments related to the site.
